You can use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to format your text.  If you prefer, you can also format your text using <b>HTML</b>.  Clicking the **Run** button will format and display your text.\n",
    "- Code cells: These contain code segments that can be executed individually.  When executed, the output of the code will be displayed below the code cell.  Click the **Run** button to execute a code segment.  You can also run a code segment by pressing `Ctrl + Enter`"
